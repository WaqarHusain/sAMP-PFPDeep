# sAMP-PFPDeep
A model for predicting short anti-microbial peptides (length &lt;=30 residues) using multiple features and deep learning approaches

# To run sAMP-PFPDeep
1. Install dependencies using ENV.yml.  
2. Input format is FASTA, so put all sequences in a single FASTA file. 
3. Mention file name and correct file path in sAMP-PFPDeep.py in start at **FASTA_INPUT_FILE_NAME = "./Example.fasta"**
4. Run sAMP-PFPDeep.py.
